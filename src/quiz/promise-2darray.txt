Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The code begins by executing the first console.log() statement, "Sum called ...". The code 
then executes the `if` statement(if(Array.isArray(arr))), which checks if the passed object 
is an array. If not, it gets automatically rejected (this is why the reject happens before 
the resolve). The code then tries to execute sumPromise1 and sumPromise2. sumPromise2 gets 
rejected before sumPromise1 gets resolved. This is because sumPromise1 takes more time to 
do, and also since sumPromise2 is just rejecting, it completes before sumPromise1. The first 
set of "Sum called ..." and "returning from sum ..." are from sumPromise1, and the second set 
(and rejection) are from sumPromise2. sumPromise1 then finishes after sumPromise2's rejection.
